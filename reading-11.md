## [Reading: nosql vs sql](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


| SQL | NoSQL |
|:----|:------|
|Relational Databases (RDBMS)|non-relational or distributed database|
|table based databases|document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|predefined schema|dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|vertically scalable|horizontally scalable|
|uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data|queries are focused on collection of documents|

### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database? Give a real world example

SQL is good for "the complex query intensive environment".

### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?Give a real world example

non- complex data database is best with noSQL.

### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

NoSQL is best for hierarchical storage.

### Which type of database is best for scalability?

NoSQL is best for scalability.

### What does SQL stand for?

Structured Query Language.

### What is a relational database?

Works with tables and supports SQL.

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

It works with tables.

### What is a ‘schema’?

It says how data can go in a table inside of a relational database.

### What is a NoSQL database?

It is a way to store lots of data in an efficent way.

### How does it work?

It works through a collection full of documents.

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

Inside is a collection that will be full of documents.

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

MongoDB is more flexible because it allows for no schema.

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

There are generally no relations in NoSQL. Because of this you have duplicate data and on update you must update multiple places.
